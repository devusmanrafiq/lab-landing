        Any references to token purchases are for informational purposes only, and only describe historical activity.
        This information should not be understood as a commitment to future token purchases for any reason. Any
        purchases may have the effect of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of tokens and may
        stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the tokens. As a result, the market price of the
        tokens may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist. Entities affiliated with the pump platform may
        purchase or sell tokens from time to time, but are not under no obligation to do so. If any purchases occur in
        the future, any such activity may be initiated, suspended, modified, or discontinued at any time, with or
        without notice. No token purchaser, holder or seller should rely on past purchases as an indication of future
        token purchases.
